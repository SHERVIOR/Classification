# Classification

# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Datasets Used
- **Cities Dataset** – Predicts city category based on features like population, temperature, etc.
- **Players Dataset** – Classifies players based on performance metrics (e.g., points, assists).
- **Titanic Dataset** – Predicts survival based on passenger features.

## Algorithms Applied
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras or scikit-learn (for Neural Networks)
- Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- Train-test split (e.g., 70-30 or 80-20)
- Evaluation using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix analysis
- Cross-validation to ensure robust results

### 3. Comparison and Insights
- Each model is trained and evaluated per dataset
- Comparison of models is done visually and quantitatively
- Code is modular to allow easy experimentation

## Key Takeaways
- Importance of data preprocessing for consistent model performance
- Different models suit different data characteristics
- Neural Networks offer flexibility but require more tuning
- Decision Trees are intuitive and interpretable
- Random Forests generally offer good performance out-of-the-box
